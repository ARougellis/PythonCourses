This repository contains material I used to get fimiliar with and hone in on statistical, analytical, and compuational skills and knowledge. 

1. **Zero2Pandas**
    - Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas
        - _Libraries_: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc
        - Test newfound abilities with assignments.
2. **100Days**
    - [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=ST9MT22024) by Dr. Angela Yu
        - 100 projects (including courses) in 100 days.
        - Covering Data Science. automation, websites, api, apps, game development, etc.
            - _Libraries_: flask, pandas, numPy, scikit-learn, plotly, matplotlib, etc
3. **AtA_portfolio_project**
    - Drawing inspiration from [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)
        - A quick little portfolio project using python to extract correaltions and info out of a movie dataset
4. **DS_ML_Bootcamp**
    - [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp) by Jose Portilla
        - Extensive Bootcamp that dives deep into concepts of Data Science and Analytics, ML/NN/DL/AI, etc
            - _ML Algorithms_: Lin/Log Regression, k-nearest, random forests, SVM, recommendation, NLP, DL, etc
            - _Libraries_: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, etc
5. **ISL_Python** (_in-progress_)
    - [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python](https://www.statlearning.com/) by G.James, D.Witten, T.Hastie, R.Tibshirani, J.Taylor
        - aka the Data Science Bible
        - I created a self guided currculum based off this textbook to dive deeper into the statistical methodologies and concepts (a great tool to dust off my stats degree, learn new concepts, and perfect older ones)
